# Simulate-Cache
 * Date: 5 December 2023
 *
 * Description: This program simulates a fully associative cache in Java. 
 * It uses an input file as the main memory and allows the user to enter 
 * addresses in the file to add to the cache. It describes the behavior 
 * of the cache depending on whether there is a hit/miss/eviction and in
 * the event of a hit, it returns the value at the memory address. In the
 * event of an eviction, it randomly evicts a row from the cache. It also
 * displays a visual of the cache to the terminal. Finally, it displays the
 * hit rate of the cache.
